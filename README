Service Bus POC


grapepatch1.7z is an example project containing Spring beans for Camel.

Install this as an artifact.

Start the Spring Boot app, then stop it (it creates some template files / folders)

create file grape/grape.artifacts to have this content -

# list of -
# groupId:artifactId:version
com.kirona.poc:grapepatch1:0.0.1


edit grape/grapeConfig.xml to have artifactory username / password, AND to have the correct local maven folder

Restart the app (you should see new routes from the artifact)
